More than 18,000 acres in size, the NAR is home to a rainforest with many native species, some of them endangered. It was established to protect some of the Big Island’s best wet native forest and unique geologic features.

The dominant wind direction is east-southeast.
Site Establishment
The NEON project team evaluated several other sites in Hawaii before settling on Pu`u Maka`ala. Site selection was conducted in cooperation with local stakeholders, including the Hawaii DOFAW and local scientists and experts of the NARS Commission.  To get permitted, the site went through a rigorous environmental assessment, involving numerous state, federal and local community groups including the Three Mountain Alliance (TMA). TMA is a partnership of organizations involved in preservation of Hawaii’s native ecosystems and responsible management of land and resources on the island. The team wanted to ensure that the construction and operation of the NEON flux tower and sampling plots would not impact endangered species or impose on local hunting traditions or culturally sensitive areas. The PUUM tower and instrument hut will be located in an area of the NAR designated as “previously disturbed” to minimize impact on pristine areas of the forest.
In addition to supporting the overall goals of the NEON project, data collected from the PUUM field site will be invaluable for several local preservation and research projects. The Pu`u Maka`ala NAR includes native koa and `ōhi`a forests. `Ōhi`a forests, which make up nearly 80% of Hawaii’s native forest land, have been struck in recent years by a fungal disease known as Rapid `Ōhi`a Death (ROD). 
NEON data will also be used by the `Alalā Project, a partnership between the Hawaii DOFAW and several other preservation groups seeking to restore Hawaii’s only native crow species to the wild. Terrestrial organismal sampling on the site will provide monitoring data for other threatened and endangered species as well, including the `i`iwi (a threatened honey creeper), the `io (a native Hawaiian hawk) and the nēnē (a native Hawaiian goose). Mosquito data from the NEON site will also help local researchers track disease vectors that may impact native avian species.
Site Exceptions
Due to the unique mix of soil conditions, flora and fauna on the island, researchers at PUUM will need to make a number of modifications to the sampling and measurement protocols used at most other NEON field sites. 

Because the island is volcanic and soil depths average just 4 inches, soil measurement methods have been modified for the site.
Field sampling schedules have been modified to minimize traffic through ecologically sensitive areas and accommodate Hawaii’s year-round growing season.
Small mammal sampling has been eliminated, as Hawaii has only one native terrestrial mammal (the Hawaiian Hoary Bat), an endangered species which is already being monitored by other research programs. Tick sampling has also been eliminated.
Tree tagging methods have been modified to avoid creating entry points for ROD in `ōhi`a trees.

The data from this field site will support a broad range of local research programs and provide new insights into the ecology of native species in Hawaii.
","Airborne Remote Sensing Surveys
Remote sensing surveys of this field site collect lidar, spectrometer and high-resolution RGB camera data.
Meteorological Measurements
The flux/meteorological tower at this site is 105’ with 6 measurement levels.  The tower top extends above the vegetation canopy to allow sensors mounted at the top and along the tower to capture the full profile of atmospheric conditions from the top of the vegetation canopy to the ground. The tower collects physical and chemical properties of atmosphere-related processes, such as humidity, wind, and net ecosystem gas exchange. Precipitation data are collected by a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) near the tower, and a series of throughfalls located in the soil array.
Phenocams
This site has one phenocam on the top of the flux tower and one near the bottom of the tower.
Soil Sensor Measurements
This site has five soil plots placed in an array within the airshed of the flux tower. The following measurements may be collected at the soil surface in each soil plot:

Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) at soil surface
Soil heat flux
Solar radiation

According to the Nature Conservancy, ""the Blue River basin encompasses a variety of freshwater ecosystems, from rolling limestone prairies to oak forests in granite canyons to bottomland hardwood forests. An astonishing array of plant and animal species depend on a healthy, sustainable Blue River basin, including the Blue River subspecies of orangebelly darter, orangethroat darter and least darter; ringed crayfish; rabbitsfoot mussel; chatterbox orchid; bald eagle, prothotary warbler and dozens of species of migrating birds. Seaside alder, found only in three widely disjunct parts of the United States—and arguably the rarest tree in North America—is more abundant on this river than anywhere else.
It is also a critical source of water for human needs. In addition to providing for agricultural needs, the river sustains the city of Durant. Ranked the fastest growing rural city in Oklahoma, Durant is home to Southeastern Oklahoma State University and the headquarters of the Choctaw Na!on of Oklahoma.
Oka’ Yanahli [oh-kuh yuh-naw-lee] means 'flowing water' in Chickasaw."" Their conservation efforts include restoration and protection of the Blue river to improve flow patterns and increase the sustainability of the wildlands that surround the river.
Please note that although this field site is geographically located in D08 Ozarks complex, the vegetation and stream characteristics of BLUE most closely align with the characteristics of D11 Southern Plains - therefore this site is part of NEON's D11.

The creek flows down the east-west trending Red Butte Canyon through the Wasatch Mountains and opens into the Salt Lake Valley. Red Butte Creek once served as the primary water source for the U.S. Army’s Fort Douglas. Red Butte Canyon is held by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a Research Natural Area (RNA) which is closed to public access. As a largely pristine watershed at the urban-wilderness interface, NEON’s data from Red Butte Creek will inform researchers and decision makers on changes to the health of this and other Great Basin watersheds.

USGS HUC: h16020204
Surface area, elevation
The drainage area that feeds Red Butte Creek is just over 8 square miles. The canyon itself is around 5.5 miles long with an elevation gain of 3215 feet from the canyon mouth at 5020 feet above sea level to the top of the canyon at 8235 feet.
Geological characteristics
Red Butte Canyon cuts a path down the western slope of the Wasatch Mountain range, which sits at the far eastern edge of the Basin and Range province, as it intersects with the Rocky Mountains above Salt Lake City, UT. While often considered to be the westernmost range of the Middle Rocky Mountains, the Wasatch share structural characteristics of the Basin and Range mountains found to their west. One of these characteristics is the steep normal fault running along their western edge which helped them rise and formed the steep slopes that Red Butte Canyon bisects. The Wasatch are a very young mountain range and are still rising at around 1mm per year, as they have for roughly the past 11 million years.  They are made up of shale and siltstone from the Triassic period.
Red Butte Canyon holds keys to Utah’s past, with the oldest rocks present having been formed millions of years ago during the Mississippian Period, when Utah looked very different from today. Over the eons what is now Red Butte Canyon has been a sea of varying depths, as well as a desert, and many landscapes and ecosystems in between. This is evident in the rocks found underlying and protruding from the canyon, most of which are varieties of sandstone, shale, limestone, and quartzite.
These rocks strongly influence the soil profile of Red Butte Canyon, with related soils often found surrounding the rocks units that weathered to create them. These soils vary in depth from just under 8 feet deep to 2 feet or less, with a large variety of grain sizes represented. Ehleringer et. al. (1992) describe them as, “neutral to slightly basic, [soils] vary in color from brick red to dark brown, with textures generally ranging from sandy to loamy clays.”
Water flow
Red Butte Creek is a free-flowing perennial stream from its headwaters near 8200 feet in elevation to around 5400 feet, when it flows into Red Butte Reservoir, then out through Red Butte Garden, and into Salt Lake City. While it is no longer a source of drinking water for the Salt Lake Valley, several recreational areas, such as the pond in Liberty Park, are fed by it. NEON’s data collection in Red Butte Creek takes place upstream of the reservoir from an altitude of around 5640 feet to 5460 feet. The water flow in Red Butte Creek is strongly influenced by seasonal trends such as the snowpack and precipitation, and base flow is maintained by groundwater inputs throughout the stream. The water is clear and quite alkaline with a high mineral content and high conductivity. The flow varies dramatically throughout the year and has high year-to-year variability as well. At the United States Geological Survey gauge station, just downstream of NEON’s study area, stream discharge has been measured for over 50 years, and has varied from less than one cubic foot per second to over 100 cubic feet per second.
Nearby land management
As with much of the Wasatch Mountains, Red Butte Canyon is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Red Butte Canyon is unique in the area, however, for its designation as a Research Natural Area. With few exceptions, only researchers with prior permission are allowed in the canyon, leaving it more pristine than other canyons and watersheds in the area. In addition, the reservoir in Red Butte Canyon is managed by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District to protect the population of endangered June Sucker (Chasmistes liorus) that have been introduced the lake.
Vegetation
Red Butte Canyon has several distinct plant communities occupying different niches. The mouth of the canyon sits in the Salt Lake Valley, with dominant vegetation reminiscent of that in the rest of the eastern Great Basin. As the canyon rises, it transitions through different vegetative zones until it enters a conifer community that resembles the southern Rocky Mountains.
The grass-forb community at the mouth of the canyon includes Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), Bluebunch Wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Big Sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata), Antelope Bitterbrush (Pursha tridentata), and Broom Snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae). At the bottom of the canyon lies a riparian zone covered by a canopy of Box Elder (Acer negundo) and Cottonwood (Populus spp.) trees. Under this, numerous smaller trees such as Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), Dogwood (Cornus sericea), and Water Birch (Betula occidentalis) intermix with Wild Mint (Mentha arvensis), Goldenrod (Salidago spp.), and Horsetails (Equisetum spp.) along the water’s edge.
Red Butte Canyon’s walls rise out of the riparian zone into a community dominated by Gambel Oak (Quercus gambelii) and Bigtooth Maple (Acer grandidentatum). Oregon Grape (Mahonia repens) spreads under this canopy, and grasses and forbs fill in areas where the canopy breaks letting light through. As the elevation rises, Curl-leaf Mountain Mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) begins to dot the canyon and the oak-maple vegetative zone gives way to one dominated by taller stands of trees. Above this, heartier shrubs and forbs that can handle life high on the mountain surround populations of Aspen (Populus tremuloides), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and White Fir (Abies concolor).

Site history & management
The Onaqui area has been grazed by domestic livestock since settlement. By the 1980s, the Bureau of Land Management instituted a light to moderate fall and winter grazing regime that continues today. Fire has always been a component of sagebrush steppe, one of the dominant vegetation types in the area. However, the invasions of exotic annual vegetation, especially Bromus tectorum, also known as drooping brome or cheatgrass, have dramatically shortened fire return intervals. The invasion-fire feedback has resulted in the loss of native perennial species from extensive areas of the region.  The restoration of sagebrush at the Onaqui area after the cheatgrass invasion and woodland expansion creates an opportunity to collect data on the changes related to invasive or non-invasive species advancement, as well as the dynamics of rodents and hantavirus.

Santa Rita Experimental Range receives 28-50 cm of rain per year, depending on elevation.  Rainfall is bimodally distributed between winter storms originating in the Pacific Ocean and summer monsoonal moisture stemming from the Gulfs of Mexico and California.  A majority of precipitation falls during intense, short duration summer thunderstorms. 
Site History
Santa Rita Experimental Range was founded in 1903. It is the longest continuously active rangeland research facility and among the five oldest biological field stations in the United States.
The site is broken into distinct pastures, through which cattle graze throughout the year in various densities and durations.  When the monsoon rains begin in early July, cattle are allowed to graze for approximately 10 days in a pasture before moving on, which prevents them from grazing plants a second time during the short summer growing season. Cattle grazing during the dormant season is also carefully managed.
Dominant Vegetation
The current vegetation at Santa Rita Experimental Range is a mix of short trees, shrubs, cacti and other succulents, perennial grasses, and other herbaceous species.  Over the last 100 years, mesquite tree abundance has steadily increased across the range (McClaran 2003).

Land use at Jornada has contrasting livestock grazing histories (including ungrazed lands), dating back to 1902, which are representative of the pervasive land use in desert-southwest wildlands. Historical accounts of the region report significant changes in vegetation starting in the late 1800s coincident with the expansion of livestock grazing. By 1912, sufficiently dramatic changes lead area scientists and private landowners to convince the U.S. government to set aside Public Domain Lands for the Jornada Range Reserve for the purpose of scientific investigation on shrub invasion and subsequent loss of forage grasses. Much of this early research focused on quantifying utilization levels for forage species, developing livestock production strategies to deal with drought, and developing methods for shrub control and grass recovery. Exclosures were constructed and long-term plots were established throughout the range to monitor the continued expansion of shrubs across the landscape. Over the decades, numerous trials of various remediation approaches were implemented, from manual and mechanical shrub removal to herbicide application to construction of terraces or other means of redirecting surface flow of runoff.

Topography, climate, and biota of the site are representative of Rocky Mountain alpine ecosystems, including extensive alpine tundra (mostly herbs, some shrubs and scree) and subalpine coniferous forests (Abies lasciocarpa and Picea engelmanii at higher elevations), talus slopes, wetlands and a variety of glacial landforms.
The site is accessible to the public, is home to the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research project, and is heavily used by researchers. Research themes include the movement of energy and nutrients across the subalpine-alpine landscape, the influence of nitrogen deposition on ecosystems and hydrology, and the influence of climate on diversity and ecosystem function. Alpine plants and animals survive on the edge of environmental tolerances, making them especially sensitive to changes in climate. Changes in the timing, form, and seasonality of precipitation as well as changes in drought frequency and intensity will alter ecosystem structure and function, ultimately leading to changes in species distributions.
High altitude aquatic ecosystems are responsive to external drivers of change, especially climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. The Niwot Ridge terrestrial site is collocated with NEON’s D13 core aquatic site, Como Creek, situated at an elevation of 3,030 m in the subalpine.

Sycamore Creek is a 5th order, intermittent Sonoran Desert stream located approximately 32 km northeast of the Phoenix, Arizona. The stream drains a watershed approximately 505 km2 (Fisher and Minckley 1978). The Sycamore Creek watershed is representative of many small watersheds in the southwest (Thomsen and Schumann 1968).  As a result, numerous aquatic ecology studies have been carried out in the stream since the 1960s. The Sycamore Creek watershed is located within Tonto National Forest and administered by the US Forest Service.

Climate
Precipitation in the Sycamore Creek watershed averages 34-58 cm, depending on elevation. Rainfall is bimodally distributed with peaks in the winter and summer (Jones et al. 1997).  Runoff from summer monsoon storms can produce severe flash flooding which can increase stream discharge several orders of magnitude within a few hours.  Mean pan evaporation is approximately six times precipitation (Fisher and Minckely 1978). During the fall and late-spring, the stream often has no surface flow. 
Dominant Vegetation
Most of the Sycamore Creek watershed is classified as Sonoran Desert scrub, with the exception of the highest elevations (Fisher and Minckley 1978).  Riparian vegetation is sparsely distributed.  Willow, cottonwood, mesquite, ash, and walnut are limited to areas inundated only during highest flows (Jones et al. 1997). 
Soil
The watershed is composed of igneous and metamorphic rock with shallow overlying soils and unconsolidated sediments (Thomsen and Schumann 1968).

It is a wadeable stream aquatic site covering a 1000-m reach of Blacktail Deer Creek, one of several creeks and streams running through the Blacktail Deer Plateau at the northern edge of the park. It is part of a watershed area encompassing 35 km2 (13.5 square miles) of the Northern Range.
BLDE is located just two miles from NEON's Yellowstone Northern Range/Frog Rock (YELL) terrestrial site. The sites are easily accessed from Yellowstone's Grand Loop Road. The site is a ¾-mile off-trail hike from the Frog Rock gravel pit, where the park stores gravel for maintenance of roads and trails.
The land outside the park is sparsely populated. The nearest communities (Gardiner, population 875, and Cooke City, population 150) are located in Montana on the northern border of the park.
Description of Landscape, Vegetation and Notable Animal Species
Yellowstone National Park is known for its stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife. It sits on a plateau in the Rocky Mountains with an average elevation of 8,000 feet. The terrain is rugged and traversed by numerous streams and rivers. The area is geologically active, with frequent minor (mostly imperceptible) earthquakes and a record of prehistoric volcanic activity. Yellowstone is also famous for its geysers, though none lie within or near the NEON field site.
More than 1,700 species of plants are considered native to the area. Much of the park is covered with conifer forests dominated by lodgepole pine. Other common conifers include whitebark pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. Groves of quaking aspen and willow are also found in the park. The Blacktail Deer Plateau, where the NEON field site is located, is considered a sagebrush-steppe ecosystem. A variety of sagebrush and grass species are found here, including mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, needlegrasses, and sedges, along with numerous species of wildflowers.
This area is considered to be one of the best habitats for megafauna in North America, supporting 60 species of mammals including several endangered species. Iconic Yellowstone mammal species include grizzly bears, black bears, bison, elk, moose, mule deer, white-tailed deer, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, cougars and lynx. Smaller mammals such as marmots, river otters, mink, martens, badgers, beavers and porcupines are also abundant. Wolves were successfully reintroduced into Yellowstone in the 1990s; a large population lives just southeast of the field site. Field researchers must stay on the lookout for wolves, bears and other dangerous or endangered species when accessing the sampling plots.
Yellowstone also is home to more than 300 species of birds, many of which nest in the park. Notable species include bald eagles, loons, ospreys, great horned owls and pileated woodpeckers.
Blacktail Deer Creek is a small, fast freshwater stream in the Blacktail Deer Plateau. It supports trout, pike and other game species.  
Scientifically Interesting Facts or Discoveries
Temperatures are warming in the Northern Rockies at a rate faster than the global average. In recent years, Yellowstone has seen reduced snowpack in the winter due to rising temperatures and reduced snowfall. These changes impact the entire watershed, which depends on melting snows in the spring to feed rivers and streams and provide moisture for growing plants. NEON data from BLDE will help researchers monitor climate change in the Northern Range and its impact on aquatic species, stream morphology, water quality and other riparian measurements.

Surface area, elevation & depth
Pringle Creek is located at an altitude of 242 meters and drains a watershed of 18.1 km2 of mixed oak forest, savanna, and riparian woodland. Portions of the Pringle Creek watershed are protected by the Caddo-LBJ National Grassland.
Geological characteristics
Pringle Creek is a low gradient sandy-bottomed stream. Due to this sandy substrate the stream banks are highly erodible. The primary soils of the Wise County area surrounding Pringle Creek are comprised of gently sloping neutral to slightly acidic soils formed from weathered sandstones and shales on upland and terrace savannahs (Ressel, 1989). The Truce-Cona and Windthorst-Chaney-Seldon series soils of the Pringle Creek watershed are deep, loamy, and sandy moderately well drained to well drained soils underlain by shaly clay, mud, or sand-stone material from the early Cretaceous (USDA, 1989).
Water flow
The surface water flow regime of Pringle Creek has similar attributes that that of semi-arid waterways. Stream discharge exhibits strong seasonal patterns, with the greatest base and pulse flows observed in mid to late spring (May through June). Throughout the rest of the year, base flows remain low but episodic high flow events associated with storms may occur at any point. Areas of the stream dry up significantly during the summer leaving behind disconnected standing pools. This seasonal drying may be exacerbated by nearby ground and surface water withdrawals for irrigation.
Nearby land management
Land use in the Pringle Creek watershed consists of a mosaic of grassland, cropland, light urban development and deciduous forest. The grasslands in the watershed are managed for wildfire using prescribed burns every 3-4 years.
Vegetation
The dense riparian canopy surrounding Pringle Creek is a mixed oak forest. Dominant species of the mixed oak forest area include post oak and black-jack oak. However, the savannah portions of watershed are dominated by little blue stem co-associated with big blue stem and Indiangrass (USDA, 2009).

Several recreational paths actually cross through the field site.
Site History
Yacolt Burn State Forest is named for the dozens of wildfires that ravaged Clark, Cowlitz and Skamania counties in southwest Washington during September 1902. With no organized system for fighting wildfires, the fires spread across nearly 239,000 acres and caused 38 deaths and widespread property losses. An extended period of hot, dry weather; high wind; an over-accumulation of timber harvest slash; and human carelessness are among the frequently cited causes of these fires. In response, the Washington Legislature established a state fire warden the following year. In 1908, private landowners formed the Washington Fire Protection Association and funded a system of fire wardens and a program of fire prevention on private lands.
The DNR replanted the forests and has maintained the area as working forest in order to:

Protect the long-term health of the forest's ecosytems
Generate revenue for the state
Provide safe, sustainable, and enjoyable recreational opportunities

Site-specific Topics

Located in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in a young forest, ABBY field site provides an interesting comparison to NEON's WREF site which is located in a nearby old growth forest that is primarily used for research.
Urban growth west of ABBY since the early 2000s has also brought neighborhoods closer to the forest. This growth has increased the demand for a variety of recreational activities. Urban planning is an active component of the land management of this ecosystem.

Vegetation and Soil
The dominant tree species are Douglas Fir which have been planted by the DNR since the Yakolt Burn in 1902. Many shrubs grow in the forest understory, including salal, Oregon-grape, red and big huckleberries, and west coast rhododendron. Dozens of plant species grow on the forest floor, including queencup beadlily, vanilla leaf, bracken fern, beargrass, twinflower, trillium, and little pipsissewa.
Climate
Typical of the Northwest, ABBY experiences very wet falls, winters, and springs; and very dry summers. The nearby Columbia River Gorge affects the valley’s climate, contributing to strong winds in any season and cool, wet weather in the winter. Average annual precipitation is about 2,540 mm annually, occurring as rain or snow during fall, winter, and spring. Summers are warm and dry.

Targeted research addresses a range of concerns and provides much of the direction in resource management.
Site-specific Topics The southernmost portion of TEAK overlaps with the Teakettle Experimental Forest, managed by the Pacific Southwest Research Station, which represents the Forest Service Research and Development (FS R&D). Although research at the Experimental Forest historically focused on watershed management and climate science, more recent topics have investigated the effects of fire and thinning treatments on mixed conifer ecosystems. Long-term databases include streamflow and sedimentation, bird census data, and snag distribution and turnover. The Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory maintains a flux tower at Shorthair Creek, the subalpine belt of a tower transect which also includes infrastructure at SJER and SOAP. The Critical Zone Observatory collects data on water, carbon and nutrient cycling across the rain-snow transition in the southern Sierra Nevada.
Vegetation
The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) classifies Lower Teakettle as evergreen forest and shrub scrub vegetation types. At a finer scale, it is a mosaic of closed canopy pine and fir forest, shrub patches, and areas of exposed rock and shallow soil, with occasional wet meadows
punctuating the tree cover. Dominant tree species include red and white fir (Abies magnifica and Abies concolor, respectively), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Stand structure is diverse, with active recruitment and extensive coarse woody debris. Although dense tree cover limits understory shrubs, bush chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens) often grows on forested slopes. Exposed rock and shallow soils support other shrub species, such mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus), greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula) and pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos nevadensis). Open pine and fir forests provide habitat for more shade-tolerant herbaceous plants, whereas meadows, streams and patches of shallow soil accommodate a greater diversity of native grasses, graminoids, and forbs.
Soil
The majority of the site consists of granitic soils common to the Sierra Nevada, primarily from the Cagwin series with smaller contributions from the Sirretta, Stecum and Umpa families, among others. The most common soils have a coarse, sandy texture and are moderately deep with poor water retention. Exposed granitic outcrops are characteristic of the area. There are a few small lakes or ponds at higher elevation in the northern portion of the site, and wet meadows occur intermittently throughout. Perennial and seasonal streams drain into the North Fork of the Kings River.

Glacial deposits overlaying granitic rocks. Quaternary on Mesozoic.

Teams working out of Toolik have studied the biological and biogeochemical attributes of Oksrukuyik Creek for decades. NEON data will contribute to these studies to help better understand tundra streams, which are rapidly changing along with the Arctic climate. 
Land cover in the Oksrukuyik Creek watershed consists of moist tundra underlain by permafrost. Although dwarf birch and dwarf willow line the banks of Oksrukuyik Creek, these species rarely grow taller than one meter and thus offer little shading.

Hydrology 
Few streams in the NEON network exhibit a flow regime as unique as Oksrukuyik Creek. Discharge falls to zero between October and March, as the stream remains entirely frozen during this period. Discharge rises rapidly following the thaw that occurs between March and June, with catastrophic ice floes and high flow events characterizing this period.  
Discharge remains steady through the summer, with occasional flood events driven by rainstorms. Base discharge steadily decreases from midsummer to early fall as snowmelt declines. As the winter freeze-up begins in September, discharge rapidly approaches zero as any precipitation transitions to snow and remains frozen.  
Chemistry 
Oksrukuyik Creek is an oligotrophic, P-limited tundra stream.  This clear-water stream drains several lakes and has little natural spring or glacial influence. The majority of nutrient fluxes occur during summer months, during times of snowmelt and summer base flow. Stream nutrient inputs are dominated by overland and subsurface flows. Hyporheic exchange is important for nutrient cycling in these ecosystems, and the size of the hyporheic zone is dictate by the spatial and temporal extent of the permafrost thaw.    
Biology
Oksrukuyik Creek has been studied for several years as part of the Arctic LTER Streams project. This stream, like other tundra streams on the North Slope, freezes solid during winter. The fauna of the stream, invertebrates (e.g., Baetis spp., Brachycentrus sp., Orthocladius spp.) need to adapt to life histories that can withstand freezing conditions, including diapause or “antifreeze” compounds, and fish to migrate to deep lakes or rivers during winter. 
The Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) is found in the stream, however slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) may also be present.  Plant life includes liverworts (Solenostoma sp.) and bryophytes (Schistidium agassizii), and filamentous algae includes the red alga Draparnaldia and Cyanophyte Spirogyra (Harvey et al. 1998).

The summer months of June through August range from 15 to 28 °C (59 to 82 °F), with an average of 22 °C (72 °F), though temperatures often reach or exceed 32 °C (90 °F) during the day.
Site History and Management
Soaproot Saddle is part of the Sierra National Forest, federal public land administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The land is managed for multiple uses and benefits, ranging from renewable resources, such as timber and forage, to recreation and research. Targeted research addresses a range of concerns and provides much of the direction in resource management. Wildland fire is of particular concern at SOAP, where foresters use a combination of prescribed fire and mechanical fuel treatment to minimize damage while maintaining a healthy fire regime.
Site-specific Topics SOAP is home to a flux tower associated with the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (CZO), which collects data on water, carbon and nutrient cycling across the rain-snow transition in the southern Sierra Nevada. CZO eddy covariance flux towers also operate at the Pacific Southwest core site, San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) and Lower Teakettle (TEAK), the other relocatable site.
Vegetation
The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) characterizes SOAP as a mix of evergreen forest and shrub scrub vegetation types. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) dominate the overstory, with co-dominant canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii). However, the interaction of long-term drought and warming has exacerbated the outbreak of pine bark beetles, leading to high Ponderosa pine mortality and a potential shift in the forest community. Mariposa manzanita
(Arctostaphylos viscida ssp. mariposa) are interspersed throughout the understory and often form dense thickets in open areas, whereas deerbrush (Ceanothus integerrimus) and poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum) are common in the shaded understory. Mountain misery (Chamaebatia foliolosa) provides dense groundcover throughout much of the site. Herbaceous plants include annual and perennial grasses, as well as a range of native forbs.
Soil
Soils are weathered from granite or granodiorite, primarily from the Holland and Chaix series, and to a lesser extent, the Chawankee and Tollhouse series. Soils are moderately deep and well-drained on mountain slopes, with shallower and excessively drained soils on steeper slopes. Exposed bedrock punctuates the landscape. Intermittent streams of the watershed drain into Big Creek, just north of the site boundary and home to the domain’s relocatable aquatic site.

The SJER is managed cooperatively by the Pacific Southwest Research Station and California State University's Agricultural Foundation. In 1934, SJER was established as California's first range research station. It was originally conceived as a cooperative interdisciplinary research center to identify cost-effect methods of commercial livestock production in the annual grass-oak pine woodlands, while maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem.
Vegetation
The SJER contains open woodland dominated by blue and interior live oaks and California Foothills pine (Pinus sabiniana) with scattered shrubs and nearly continuous cover of herbaceous plants. Swales occur in low areas between rises. Dominant shrub species include ceanothus (both wedgeleaf ceanothus and chaparral whitehorn) and manzanita.  Herbaceous plants are generally annuals including grasses (e.g., pine bluegrass soft chess, foxtail fescue), and various legumes. Perennials, primarily rushes, are found in the bottomlands. Native perennial bunchgrasses are uncommon and occur on north slopes.
Climate
The climate is Mediterranean. Winters are cool and wet, with frequent frosts and monthly mean temperatures between 4 and 10 °C.  The area drains into a small tributary of the San Joaquin River.  Summers are hot and dry, with maximum daily temperatures commonly exceeding 38 °C and monthly mean temperatures ranging from 24 to 27 °C.
Soils
Bedrock is mainly granitic. Soils on slopes are shallow, residual, and granitic and generally of the Ahwahnee series. Soils in swales are deeper, alluvial and generally of the Visalia series. Slope and swale soils have a relatively low water-holding capacity. Granitic outcrops are common on slopes.
Geology: 
Granodiorite and quartz monzonite. Mesozoic.
USGS HUC: h18040007
Dominant Phenology Species:
Quercus douglasii, Erodium botrys, Bromus diandrus
Mean Canopy Height:
The mean canopy height is 21 m.
Wind Direction:
The dominant wind direction is northwest.
Site-specific topics
NEON’s science focus for the Pacific Southwest is on a climate gradient, extending from the core site in the oak woodland at the SJER, up through an elevation gradient into mixed conifer and red fir forests. The low density of cattle, light grazing management and fire management are also representative of land use practices throughout the extent of this ecosystem. This core site provides:

A representative wildland to contrast the design of the relocatable sites
Statistical power for regional-scale understanding
A robust design to address expected future changes in climate that are, in turn, expected to influence biodiversity, biogeochemistry, and infectious and invasive species biology

Research history
Databases maintained at the SJER include:

Long-term climate information
Publications based on information acquired at the forest
Spring bird counts beginning in the mid-1980s
Long-term acorn production censuses
Grazing intensity information.

More than 500 scientific publications have emerged from work at the SJER ranging from studies on fire ecology to sulfur fertilization. Learn more about the SJER's history here.

2.1 km2
USGS HUC: h03080103
Surface area, elevation & depth
Suggs Lake is an isothermal, mesotrophic lake 0.73 km2 in area and situated at an altitude of 29 m. It has a maximum depth of 5.7 m and a mean depth of 2.5 m.
Geological characteristics
Suggs lake is classified as a clastic upland lake with substrates composed generally of clays and organics. The limestone geology is overlain by a variable mixture of sand, gravel, clay, phosphate, and carbonate deposited during the Pleistocene interglacials. 
Water flow
Suggs Lake is primarily surface water dominated, although it does interact with the regional aquifer to some extent. This lake lies within a greater flow through wetland complex. Inflow lies on the SW part of the lake with a smaller inflow from the E edge of the lake. Outflow is through the NW part of the lake as part of the greater wetland complex. Suggs Lake is classified as a seepage lake dominated by groundwater flow with the local aquifer, but it is also fed by the local surface and subsurface flow through the wetland complex. There is no discernible inflow or outflow to Suggs Lake, although there is some evidence of water inflow from the south western edge of the lake with a flow pattern to the N and NW. Suggs Lake is a seepage lake and due to its formation by solution processes, there is a strong link between the lake and the groundwater. In areas where the potentiometric surface of the Floridan aquifer system is at a higher altitude than the water table of the surficial aquifer that overlies it, water moves upward toward the land surface. These areas are referred to as discharge areas or areas of artesian flow.
Nearby land management
Regular prescribed burns are typical in this region.
Vegetation
Lake Suggs has large areas of emergent macrophytes, and is surrounded by cypress swamps and old pastures. The swamps and adjacent hardwood forests are dominated by Bald Cycpress (Taxodium distichum), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), water oak (Quesrcus nigra) and slash pine. The diatom or assemblage is dominated by planktonic forms, notably M. herzogii and Aterionella ralfsii. 
Biological characteristics
Lake Suggs has a dense population of salamanders, with other common species of amphibians including greater siren (Siren lacertina), lesser siren (Siren intermedia), two-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma means), one-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma pholeter), narrow-striped dwarf siren (Pseudobranchus axanthus), the broad-striped dwarf siren (Pseudobranchus striatus) and the pig frog (Rana grylio).
Chemistry
Suggs Lake has been sampled for chemical constituents weekly since the 1970’s. Seasonal variability in chemical parameters is largely controlled by the surrounding wetlands and hydrology. Suggs Lake is a high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lake with an average concentration of 20 mg L -1. Due to the high DOC content, the lake is rather acidic with a pH of 4.74.and an acidity of 15.10 mg CaCO3 L -1. Low oxygen levels are common, with common values around 5.60 mg L -1. The lake is characterized by a Chlorophyll a concentration of 4 μg L -1. NEON will contribute to this long-term stream chemistry data set through 12 lake water grab samples annually and continuous sensor data over 30 years. Such chemical measurements along with other NEON-generated data on terrestrial chemical parameters will enable novel investigations in ecohydrology and cross system studies.

Stream Description
Despite the large watershed size (2,875 kilometers2), the Arikaree is a small, wadeable stream that drains tall-grass prairie and flows through a sand-alluvial basin. The stream is largely fed by surface precipitation and is subject to flooding when large, localized storms occur in the watershed. The Arikaree flows primarily during the winter, and often dries completely during summer due to dry conditions and groundwater withdrawals for irrigation. 
Site Management
The Arikaree site is located on Nature Conservancy land that is maintained as an active cattle ranch but is also managed to ensure a diverse tall-grass prairie and bird community persists.
Site Specific Topics
NEON collects a standard suite of aquatic data at Arikaree; however, data collected at this site captures regional hydrological change and may lead to a better understanding of climate change trends in the area.
Vegetation
Land cover at the Arikaree site is dominated by grasslands with a few trees located near the stream edge. Cottonwood trees cover 30% of the ground in the surrounding area; willow trees cover 10% at the stream bank. During mid-summer, the stream channel is dominated by cattails (Typha sp.).

Site history & management
The site is at the edge of a non-tilled experimental field that is used for the long-term sustainable Dryland Agroecosystems Project (DAP), which was initiated in 1985 at three sites in eastern Colorado (Sterling, Stratton, and Walsh) to evaluate the effects of cropping intensity on production, water use efficiency and selected soil chemical and physical properties. The DAP site was established in 1985 and was chosen because of representative soils present in the catena.
Over 100 data products are generated from this field site. Thousands of specimens and samples are achived from STER annually as well.
","Limited","8C/46.4F","370 mm","Cultivated Crops","1364 m","Vegetation
Before establishment of the no-till cropping systems, the site was under conventional tillage since it was taken from native sod in about 1910. Conventional tillage from 1910 to 1985 ranged from moldboard plowing in the early years to sweep tillage in the later years. The primary crop was winter wheat grown in a wheat-fallow rotation. Proso millet also had been grown occasionally during a few years before 1985. Cropping systems under no-till management were initiated in 1985. These systems included:

Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow
Winter wheat-maize (Zea mays L.)-fallow
Winter wheat-maize-proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.)-fallow
Continuous cropping (crops grown over the years included maize, sorghum, winter wheat, forage millet, and sunflower)
Perennial grass

Grass stands were established in the spring of 1986 and contain a mixture of perennial species including warm and cool season grasses.
Climate
Summers in Sterling are hot with low humidity and winters are typically around freezing point but can drop to lower temperatures. Occasional hailstorms and thunderstorms are expected during the growing seasons. North Sterling also experiences seasonal high winds and tornados. NEON’s North Sterling site is owned privately and managed by a local farmer; it is subject to the shifting agronomic and economic needs of the area.

Site-specific topics
This site provides a baseline understanding of the regional effects of climate change and chemical climate, including dust and Front Range pollution, to understand and contrast ecological process with other within- and cross-domain analyses. NEON collects a standard suite of data at North Sterling; however, data from this particular location provides a baseline for evaluating changes due to invasive species and infectious disease along a rural wildland, suburban fringe, urban gradient in time or space. Overall, the Front Range of Colorado is growing at 3 times the national average with the population expected to surpass 5.7 million by 2030. Conversion of native vegetation to urban and suburban landscapes drastically alters biological diversity, reduces soil organic matter and alters the temporal and spatial distribution of plant biomass. This relocatable site is designed to represent economic and agronomic decisions typically found in farming practices in eastern Colorado, which is a shifting agricultural site in Domain 10.

From the mid 1800’s until about 1930, the land was heavily harvested and burned with extensive cutovers and destructive wildfires. Farming was attempted on the cutover land and the open areas were subsequently grazed and mowed until the mid1950s.
In the 1950’s the property came under new ownership and a detailed management plan was developed calling for reforestation, sustainable timber harvest, and timber stand improvements. The new owners undertook extensive reforestation, planting nearly140000 trees, and gave the property its current name, Treehaven. In 1979, 850 acres were donated to the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and the university has since expanded to 1400 acres through additional purchases and donations. Since acquiring the land in 1979, UWSP students and staff have used the site to study forest vegetation, fire history ,watersheds, and soils, In addition, forest improvement practices (timber harvest, thinning, and planting) have occurred on nearly 500 acres.
Vegetation
Most of the forests on the property are second growth forests which naturally regenerated after extensive fires and grazing were excluded from the site; however, there are a few, isolated, large diameter trees that pre-date the period of heavy timber harvest. Lowland areas consist of black spruce/tamarack and non-forested acid bog environments, along with a mix of sedge, shrub, hardwood and cedar wetlands. Upland sites are primarily composed of aspen, white birch, and red maple, with a lesser area of mixed red pine, white pine, white spruce, and balsam fir. Red pines planted under the 1956 management plan are prominent along roads throughout the property. A minor component of northern hardwoods and hemlock hardwoods are also present in smaller area, especially on the western edge of the property. Management activities in the proximity of NEON’s tower currently are geared to the promotion of sugar maple.
Climate
Treehaven’s climate is typical of northern to north-central Wisconsin. It is a humid continental climate with warm summers and no dry season. The warm season lasts from approximately mid-May to mid-September with the warmest temperatures typically in July (average high 79 F). The cold season lasts from November to March with the coldest temperatures typically in January (average low 4 F). The annual average temperature is 41.6 F, and temperatures rarely drop below -17 F or above 87 F.
Average rainfall is 31.49 inches and snowfall is average snowfall is approximately 62 inches per year. Wind speeds are typically calm to moderate, rarely exceeding 20 mph.
Daylight hours vary significantly throughout the course of the year with the longest day in June having 15:42 hours of daylight and the shortest day in December having 8:41 hours of daylight.

Surface area, elevation & depth
Crampton Lake is approximately 26 hectares surface area. The max depth is about 17.5 meters and average depth around 5 m. Structurally, there are two significant bays and one island. There are two deep holes which account for the max depth while much of the bottom is 1-10 m deep. Crampton Lake is at approximately 591 m altitude.
Hydrology and Geology
Crampton Lake is a seepage lake, with no significant surface water inlet or outlet. It is primarily rain-fed, with some contribution from groundwater. There is a small, slowly flowing inlet from a bog on the northeast edge.
Crampton is generally completely ice covered from about late November until late March. It stratifies annually a few weeks after ice off. The mean depth of the metalimnion is roughly 4 to 9 meters. The lake destratifies in early November. Average secchi depth is around 4.5 meters.
The substrate is mostly organic muck, silt, and sand. There are areas where gravel is also common. Crampton has a more complicated topography than the typical kettle lake in the region, but was also carved by retreating glaciers of the Laurentide Ice Sheet about 18,000 years ago.  The bedrock is a migmatitic gneiss and amphobole dating from the late to early Archean.
Biology
The near-shore emergent aquatic vegetation is dominated by pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), which covers much of the shore. At slightly deeper depths (up to approximately 4 m) bur-reed grass (Sparganium angustifolium) dominates at the surface. Other emergent and floating-leafed plants include pond lilies (Nymphaea odorata and Nuphar sp.) and several pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.). Three-way sedge (Dulichium arundinaceum), a mostly terrestrial species, also occurs in the lake. Submerged vegetation includes two species of quillwort (Isoetes lacustris and I. tenella), pipewort (Eriocaulon aquaticum), dwarf watermilfoil (Myriophyllum tenellum), water lobelia (Lobelia dortmanna), and at least one species of macro-algae (Nitella sp.).
Fish species include largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), bluntnose minnow (Pimephales sp.), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), and johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum).
Chemistry
Crampton Lake is a clear water, oligotrophic lake. The dissolved oxygen near the surface is very high, generally above 95%. Conductivity near the surface is between 13 and 15 microsiemens per cm. Water temperature in mid-summer is roughly 24 degrees Celsius. After destratification, water temperature is around 6 degrees Celsius throughout.
The waters of Crampton are neutral, with a pH of about 6.5. It has extremely low ionic strength and is sensitive to slight changes of acidity. The alkalinity and ANC (acid neutralizing capacity) tend to be between 0.15 and -0.05 meq/L or between 6 and -3 mg/L CaCO3.
Nearby Land Use and Vegetation
For general area land use and vegetation characteristics, see UNDERC field site specific description.
Crampton Lake’s immediate shore is dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga Canadensis), white cedar (Picea glauca), and red maple (Acer rubrum). Also present are red pine (Pinus resinosa) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea).

The majority of the land is ​owned by the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus. The NEON field site also incorporates some farmland owned by a private farmer, which makes up 25% of the total site area.
Located in the southwestern corner of the island, where it is relatively arid, this field site provides an excellent contrast to the pristine forest conditions at the Guánica field site. The station was established as a research and development center in 1946 to study agricultural practices and establish best practices for the area. The land has primarily been used for dairy cattle grazing and growing feed for the cattle industry, including hay and sorghum. Parts of the site are dedicated to grow other crops, including mangoes, corn, sorghum and squash. It is highly managed, with agricultural activities taking place year round. Much of the soil has been heavily compacted by cattle movements and enriched by the application of manure and other fertilizers. Data gathered at LAJA will help researchers evaluate the impact of agriculture and human activity on the local ecosystem and monitor these impacts over time.

","Yes","20C/68F","1290 mm","Shrub/Shrub","32 m","Watershed Size
0.81 km2
USGS HUC: h03080103
Surface area, elevation & depth
Barco Lake is 0.12 km2 in surface area, at an elevation of 28 m and sits within a 0.9 km2 watershed. Barco Lake has a maximum depth of 7.1 m and a mean depth of 4.3 m.
Water Flow
Barco Lake is a typical lentic water body without significant surface inflows or outflows. Instead, water may be largely derived from lateral groundwater seepage through the surrounding well-drained uplands and/or from artesian sources via connections with the underlying limestone aquifer. There is no discernible inflow or outflow to Barco Lake, although there is some evidence of water inflow from the northern edge of the lake with a flow pattern to the S and SE. Virtually all the water inflow to Barco Lake is groundwater, with up to 8 inches per year: the main flow of groundwater is NE to SW and groundwater flow is downward beneath most of Barco Lake. Fluctuation in the water table is generally between 1 to 1.5 m but can reach up to 3 to 4 m during storm event.
Vegetation
The immediate watershed of Barco Lake is characterized by a forest of widely spaced pine trees (Pinus clauda) and a sparse understory of deciduous oaks. Fairly dense ground cover of grasses and herbs is typical of these environments. Fire is a dominant factor in the ecology of this community.
Biological characteristics
Common animals include tiger salamander, barking treefrog, spadefoot toad, gopher frog, gopher tortoise, worm lizard, fence lizard, mole skink, indigo snake, coachwhip snake, pine snake, short-tailed snake, crowned snake, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, bobwhite, ground dove, red-headed woodpecker, rufous-sided towhee, fox squirrel and pocket gopher. Barco Lake is an important breeding areas for terrestrial amphibians, including the threatened gopher frog, as well as many unusual or endemic insects, as well as an important watering holes for a number of mammals and birds, including ducks and wading birds.
Chemistry
Barco Lake is an oligotrophic acidic lake (pH 4.5). The lake is clear with a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of ~ 2 mg L -1 . The water chemistry is highly influenced by the rainwater and interactions with groundwater. Total phosphorous and nitrate concentrations are ~ 39 μg L -1 and 14 μg L -1 , respectively, and SO4 2- ~ 2.18 mg L -1 . Chlorophyll a concentration is ~ 2.74 μg L -1 (James, 1991). Upgradient of Barco Lake the water remains oxic as it moves downward. Downgradient of Barco Lake, the oxic groundwater mixes with lakewater leakage in a highly reducing (methanogenic, low-sulfide), silicate-carbonate mineral environment.
Geological characteristics
Estimated to be at least 1000 years old, Barco Lake is classified as a lentic sandhill upland lake underlain by sandy substrate and organic deposits that increase with depth. It is underlain by the Floridan Aquifer dominated by a limestone and dolomite geology. The limestone geology is overlain by a thick mixture of sand, gravel, clay, phosphate, and carbonate deposited during the Pleistocene interglacials. The overlying sands are highly weathered and have very low cation-exchange capacity.

At the SCBI, the forest was logged multiple times during the past 300 years and was managed mostly as farmland when acquired by the federal government in 1903. One reason that wildlands are found disproportionately in the mountain province of the domain is that the steep slopes and shallow soils are relatively unproductive for agriculture. Here too the site is typical of the domain, encompassing the full range of lithologic, edaphic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical conditions found in the Mid-Atlantic Domain.
Vegetation
(SCBI) site consists of mature (> 100 year) and young (< 40 year) secondary forest that is primarily deciduous and indicative of hardwood forests in the Middle Atlantic Domain. This forest is Eastern Deciduous and dominated by oak, hickory, ash and tulip popular. Young forests are dominated by white ash, black locust, and dogwood. Invasive tree species (autumn olive, tree-of-heaven, princess tree) are present along edges and disturbed sites.

Site history
The Bartlett forest has a history of logging dating from colonial times through the beginning of the 20th century. Approximately 70% of the land area has remained uncut since the early 1900s. Natural disturbances include late 19th century fire, beech scale-Nectria complex (beech bark disease) beginning in the 1940s, severe wind disturbance resulting from hurricanes in 1938 and 1954 and a damaging ice storm in 1998.

Exogenous factors likely to affect forest growth and composition into the future include climate change, increasing regional rates of atmospheric deposition (S, N and Hg), and new invasive species, such as the hemlock wooly adelgid, emerald ash borer, and Asian long horned beetle, whose ranges are likely to expand within the region. Bartlett Experimental Forest also represents the most Northeastern NEON site, and anchors the top of the north-south nitrogen deposition gradient along the eastern-side of the US.
Vegetation
The Bartlett site is primarily Eastern Deciduous, boreal ecotone. Nearly all of the Bartlett Experimental Forest is now covered by high forest. The primary forest cover type is the sugar maple-beech-yellow birch type. The upper elevations support stands of spruce and fir. Softwoods such as hemlock, balsam fir and spruce are commonly mixed with hardwoods, especially on cool steep slopes or on the poorly drained soils at lower elevations. Although white pine occurs mostly in stands at lower elevations, scattered specimens can be found over a large part of the forest. The site provides the deciduous-to-boreal forest transitional ecotone towards the ecosystems in the North.

This site is located at ~ 3 miles SE of the town of Woodworth, ND in the Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge which is at the center of one of the largest roadless blocks of native prairie left in the Upper Great Plains.
Site history & management
This site has been restored to native vegetation, structure and function.
Site specific topics & science rationale
Woodworth provides a baseline understanding of a core wildland system that is historically representative of the region and provides meaningful comparison to the other sites in the region that are managed with different degrees of grazing intensity. While there is little urban development in the area, this site is paired with other grassland sites within the NEON continental design: it provides a contrast to sites that may receive chemical climate inputs from agronomic practices, as well as sites from nearby growing urban environments. The Woodworth site also provides an understanding of tall grass prairie environments and serves as a benchmark for detecting and exploring the causes and consequences of environmental change taking place throughout the grasslands of the Northern Plains Domain, with results relevant to semi-arid grassland ecosystems worldwide.  
Vegetation
Woodworth contains a mix of native grasslands, tame grasses and legumes with many species of wildflowers, and unique xeric (dry) mixed-grass prairies containing a plant community unique to North Dakota and the Great Plains. 
Biological conditions
Overall, the Northern Plains-Woodworth site retains most of the features representative of pre-settlement biotic and edaphic conditions, with large native herbivores. The Refuge and surrounding area also provides breeding and resting habitat for more than 293 bird species, and has been designated as one of America's Top 100 Globally Important Bird Areas (IBA) by the American Bird Conservancy.

DCFS covers 7.8 km2 (3 square miles) of grazing land in Stutsman County, ND, between the tiny communities of Pingree and Woodworth.
The population here is sparse, but the land has been transformed by agricultural activities over the last 150 years. The field site has been used only for grazing, but other land in the surrounding area has been converted to corn and soybean production. 
DCFS is located in an area known as the ""Prairie Pothole Region,"" a band of tall and mixed prairie that stretches across parts of North and South Dakota, Minnesota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Historically, this area supported tall to mid-height prairie grasses, including blue gamma and green needlegrass. The land here is pocked by thousands of depressions left behind by glaciers 10,000 years ago, resulting in a series of small lakes and wetland areas known as prairie potholes. These potholes receive most of their water from spring snowmelt and are a primary source of groundwater recharge for the region.
NEON data will help researchers monitor the effects of climate change on the Northern Plains ecosystem. Over the last 30 years, the hydrological cycle in the plains has changed dramatically, trending wetter overall and diverging from the historical ten-year cycles. Temperatures are also rising, leading to changes in plant phenology cycles and species distribution that could negatively impact migratory bird populations and other animal species.
Over 100 data products are generated from this field site. Thousands of specimens and samples are also archived from DCFS.

Overview
The Northern Plains domain is dominated by prairie grasslands, including short, tall and mixed prairie grasses. There are more than 50 species of grass native to the domain, including bluestem, switchgrass, wheatgrass, needlegrass, blue gamma and buffalograss. The mix of grasses in each area is heavily dependent on soil type and precipitation patterns.
DCFS is located in an area known as the ""Prairie Pothole Region,"" a band of tall and mixed prairie that stretches across parts of North and South Dakota, Minnesota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Historically, this area supported tall to mid-height prairie grasses, including blue gamma and green needlegrass. The land here is pocked by thousands of depressions left behind by glaciers 10,000 years ago, resulting in a series of small lakes and wetland areas known as prairie potholes. These potholes receive most of their water from spring snowmelt and are a primary source of groundwater recharge for the region.
These waters and wetlands create prime breeding grounds for waterfowl and shorebirds. Roughly half of North American migratory waterfowl breed in the Prairie Pothole region, including mallard, gadwell, blue-winged teal, northern shoveler, northern pintail, redhead and canvasback ducks. Other species, including snow geese, lesser scaup and wigeon pass through the area on their way to northern breeding grounds. Many shorebirds such as plovers, sandpipers and godwits also breed in the area or stop here during migration.
In addition to birds, these wetland areas also provide habitat for numerous insect, reptile, amphibian and mammal species. Muskrat, mink, raccoon, red fox, coyote and striped skunk can be found in the local area, along with the northern leopard frog, tiger salamander, eastern painted turtle and eastern garter snake. Many species of insect pollinators, including various species of moths and butterflies, breed or pass through the area.
Eastern North Dakota receives slightly more rainfall than the western parts of the state, averaging 22.5 inches (57.2 cm) annually. Historically, precipitation patterns have followed a ten-year cycle of wetter and drier years, with periodic droughts. Typical summertime temperatures are in the low to mid 80s (26-29 °C), with occasional days in the 90s and a record high of 106 °F (41.1 °C). Winters are bitter cold, with lows hovering near 0°F (-18 °C) and a record low of -38 °F (-38.8 °C). Both plant and animal species are adapted to withstand these variations in temperature and precipitation.
Scientifically Interesting Facts or Discoveries
DCFS produces approximately 105 terrestrial data products. Some data products are available at the site going back to 2017, including soil physical and chemical properties, plant phenology observations, insect and small mammal collection, and meteorological sensor data.
This field site provides a clear contrast to the wilderness area at Chase Lake (which includes the terrestrial site, Woodworth), which will allow researchers to better understand how grazing impacts prairie ecosystems and biodiversity. Understanding the impact of cattle grazing on the mix of grass species and monitoring invasive grass species will be of particular interest here.
NEON data will help researchers monitor the effects of climate change on the Northern Plains ecosystem. Over the last 30 years, the hydrological cycle in the plains has changed dramatically, trending wetter overall and diverging from the historical ten-year cycles. Temperatures are also rising, leading to changes in plant phenology cycles and species distribution that could negatively impact migratory bird populations and other animal species.
History and Land Ownership
DCFS and PRLA were established on state trust land that is managed by the North Dakota Department of Trust Lands.
Native American populations have lived in the Northern Plains for thousands of years, most notably tribes of the Mandan Nation. European settlers began arriving in large numbers when the Dakota Territory was established in 1861.
In 1889, when North Dakota became a state, the federal government gifted more than three million acres of land to the state through the Enabling Act. The land was to be held in trust in perpetuity for the purpose of funding public education in the state. Trust land was established in every North Dakota township for this purpose. Public schools were build on some parcels of land, and others were used to generate funds for schools through selling mineral rights or leasing land to local farmers for grazing. The DCFS site is located on land that has been leased for grazing for more than 100 years.
A North Dakota university planned to establish a field school on the site during the NEON construction period. While the school was never funded or built, Dakota Coteau Field School sites take their names from this plan.
Current Land Management
The land is currently used for cattle grazing. There are no other active land management activities at the site.
Land Use and Site Management History
The site has been managed by the North Dakota Department of Trust Lands and leased to local farmers for cattle grazing since the late 1800s. It has never been tilled, built upon or used for other purposes since the North Dakota territory was established. 
The surrounding area is changing rapidly, with more land being converted to corn and soybean farming.

It is also co-located with the terrestrial field site Lenoir Landing (LENO). The Lower Tombigbee River is the section of the river and watershed below where the Black Warrior River joins. The drainage area of the river is approximately 4,659 square miles and is composed mainly of rural coastal plains of Alabama and Mississippi. 
NEON's field sites in the Ozarks Complex are positioned to capture chemical, physical, and biological changes in aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial environments along the Tombigbee Waterway. The entire watershed experiences major precipitation pulses from tropical storms and hurricanes. Data collected at NEON's D08 field sites provide valuable insights into the impacts of such pulses on nutrients, organic matter, and biota as they propogate downstream from the BLWA site to the TOMB site. The Tombigbee also serves as one of the principal routes of commercial navigation in the the southeast U.S.

Geology
Alluvial, coastal and terrace deposits.  Holocene.
Hydrology
The surface water flow regime of the Lower Tombigbee River exhibits predictable seasonal patterns: base discharge steadily increases from December through may then decreases until late summer when, when annual lows typically ensue. The large watershed size usually ensures that few intense flood events transpire, though moderate flooding may occur at any point throughout the year. 
The coastal plain aquifer is the principal aquifer in the region from which groundwater is extracted and is comprised largely of unconsolidated sediments.
Chemistry
The Lower Tombigbee receives large amounts of pollutant loadings via point and nonpoint sources, such as wastewater treatment, industry, forestry, urbanization, mining disposal, animal waste, and agriculture. Large amounts of impervious surface in the watershed increase the amount of pollutants delivered to the aquatic system. 
Water quality is a concern in the Lower Tombigbee basin. Elevated levels of nutrients, metals (e.g., mercury), pesticides, organic toxic chemicals, and pathogens are frequently observed in the Lower Tombigbee River. Silt and sediment inputs are also high as a result of watershed activities. In addition to high nutrient concentrations leading to harmful algal blooms and decreases in oxygen, increases in organic pollutants in this region further deplete the oxygen availability, which can have large impacts on the river biology.
Biology
The Tombigbee River drainage is a hotspot of biodiversity due to long periods free of major geological change (e.g., lack of glaciation) and is among the most critical watersheds for biodiversity conservation in the country. Mettee et al. (1987) documented 121 fish species in the Tombigbee drainage. The NEON Aquatic site is located in the Lower Tombigbee River, which has been recognized by the Nature Conservancy as having 5 at-risk mussel and fish species. 
The Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi) has been extirpated from the Lower Tombigee and is listed as historically endangered. Currently, Alabama sturgeon can only be found in the lower reaches of the Alabama River, however historically supported populations in the Tombigbee River.
Vegetation along the river corridor is largely soft woods such as pines.

"Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Twin Creeks","GRSM","Appalachians & Cumberland Plateau","D07","TN","","35.688960000000","-83.501950000000","Relocatable Terrestrial","","National Park Service","Great Smoky Mountains National Park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, the lower section in latitude of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which divides the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.
Site history & management
The park was chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. It encompasses 814 square miles (2,108 km²), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern U.S.It was the first national park whose land was paid for in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds. It is the most visited national park in the U.S., and on its route from Maine to Georgia, the Appalachian Trail also passes through the center of the park. 
 

","Yes","13C/55.4F","1396 mm","Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest","579 m","Climate
The park normally has very high humidity and precipitation, averaging from 55 inches (1,400 mm) per year in the valleys to 85 inches (2,200 mm) per year on the peaks. This area receives more annual rainfall than anywhere else in the U.S. outside of the Pacific Northwest and parts of Alaska. Most of the park has a humid continental climate more comparable to locations much farther north, as opposed to the humid subtropical climate in the lowlands.
Topography
Elevations in the park range from 876 feet (267 m) at the mouth of Abrams Creek to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains are greater than 6,000 feet (1,829 m). The wide range of elevation mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern U.S.
Vegetation
The park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (760 km2), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area. It is one of the largest stands of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America. Over 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser Fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.
Geology: 
Snowbird group, siltstone and sandstone. Precambrian.
USGS HUC: h06010107
Dominant Phenology Species:
Liriodendron tulipfera, Acer rubrum, Acer pensylvanicum
Mean Canopy Height:
The mean canopy height is 30 m.
Soil Family:
Loamy, skeletal, isotic, mesic.  Typic Humudepts.
Wind Direction:
The dominant wind direction is northwest.
Biological characteristics
The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give Great Smoky Mountain Park an unusual richness of biota. About 10,000 species of plants and animals are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present. Park officials count more than 200 species of birds, 66 species of mammals, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering at least 1,800. An experimental reintroduction of elk (wapiti) into the park began in 2001. During the most recent ice age, the northeast-to-southwest orientation of the Appalachian mountains allowed species to migrate southward along the slopes rather than finding the mountains to be a barrier. As climate warms, many northern species are now retreating upward along the slopes and withdrawing northward, while southern species are expanding.
Site-specific topics
Biodiversity along elevational gradients respond to climatic change in various ways. A key attribute in choosing Great Smoky is that it provides robust conditions to test ecological theory in the controls of biodiversity movement and change in species composition and associated ecosystem processes.
